Write example: delay network: difference of delay and non-delay.
	title(sprintf('%s :: %s', pm.neuron_model, pm.simu_method));
	ras_plot(ras, 0, pm.t, 1:100);

Add example using
  [Y2, T2] = SpikeSlicing(X, ras, pm.stv, id_to, id_from, t_range);

Test simulators:
	delta V - dt, delta ras - dt
	1. Self convergence test:
		use the same code for reference and test.
	2. Self consistency test:
		compare SSC-Sparse, SSC-Sparse2 and SSC;
		compare simple and SSC;
		compare delay and SSC.
		compare SSC and exported events to single neuron.
	3. cross validation:
		compare legency and SSC.
		compare HH-cont-syn.

Test of pm.extI
Use pm.extI for Hawkes model.

Test the optimized IF-jump and add it.

semilogy(sort(diff(ras0(:,2))))
loglog(sort(diff(ras0(:,2))))
hist(diff(ras(ras(:,1)==1, 2)), 200);
