Make it possible to input negative poisson input.

By extend ?? class to include strength item.
Add override annotation.

Add output of all poisson events.

Test:
Same old result. same execution time.  
   done.
   good.
   
Same old result by give strength by hand.


Same single neuron behaviour by inject all events.


Finish: test/test_cubic_solver

Fix sine current input. See also HH_usage_ex2.m

Write example: delay network: difference of delay and non-delay.
	title(sprintf('%s :: %s', pm.neuron_model, pm.simu_method));
	ras_plot(ras, 0, pm.t, 1:100);

Write test for 'HH-PT-GH'
	figure(1);
	t = (1:size(X,2))*pm.dt;
	cla
	ras_plot(ras, 0, pm.t, [], 100);
	hold on
	plot(t, X);
	hold off

Test and optimize IF-jump
